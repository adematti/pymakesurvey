pymakesurvey - Python version of make_survey
============================================

Introduction
------------

**pymakesurvey** is a package to create realistic mock galaxy catalogs from periodic boxes.
It is inspired by make_survey (https://github.com/cmcbride/make_survey).
The remap.py script stems from some code found on the internet, which I do not find anymore.
If you are the author of this script, please let me know and I will credit you.

- scipy
